            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
            <p>Hi! We are a team of crazy horse people 🤪.
                We love our horses! We thrive on teaching how to properly connect with horse and how teach them how to,
                eventually,
                become an indepent rider. Our utlimate goal is make sure the student has learned and feels confident by
                the end of
                each or trail ride 😊.
                We have meet ups at the stables here in Currium. We have coffee meetups and then go out for a ride!

                <hr>
                <p>We opened our riding school/club in 1983. It started by Harry Delayer.
                    Harry was a world renowed show jumper. He won the Triple Crown three times with his horse Snowman,
                    an Amish
                    Draft mix.
